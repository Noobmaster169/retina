"""Proxy error hierarchy and wire-format rendering.

Every failure the proxy generates itself (as opposed to relaying from a provider)
becomes a `ProxyError`. Each carries an HTTP status and a stable machine-readable
`code`, and renders into the Anthropic error envelope — a caller that gets the wrong
shape sees an SDK parse failure instead of the real message.
